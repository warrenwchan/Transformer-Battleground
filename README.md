# Transformer-Battleground

## Test your Transformer stats to see which bot and team comes out alive.
## Some basic rules include:
* If any fighter is down 4 or more points of courage and 3 or more points of strength
compared to their opponent, the opponent automatically wins the face-off regardless of
overall rating (opponent has ran away).
* Otherwise, if one of the fighters is 3 or more points of skill above their opponent, they win
the fight regardless of overall rating.
* The winner is the Transformer with the highest overall rating.

* In the event of a tie, both Transformers are considered destroyed.
* Any Transformers who don’t have a fight are skipped (i.e. if it’s a team of 2 vs. a team of 1, there’s
only going to be one battle).
*The team who eliminated the largest number of the opposing team is the winner.
## Special rules:
* Any Transformer named Optimus Prime or Predaking wins his fight automatically regardless of
any other criteria.
* In the event either of the above face each other (or a duplicate of each other), the game
immediately ends with all competitors destroyed.
