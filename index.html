      <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
      <p>● A battle between opponents uses the following rules:</p>
      <p>○ If any fighter is down 4 or more points of courage and 3 or more points of strength compared to their opponent, the opponent automatically wins the face-off regardless of overall rating (opponent has ran away).</p>
      <p>○ Otherwise, if one of the fighters is 3 or more points of skill above their opponent, they win the fight regardless of overall rating.</p>
      <p>○ The winner is the Transformer with the highest overall rating.</p>
      <p>● In the event of a tie, both Transformers are considered destroyed.</p>
      <p>● Any Transformers who don’t have a fight are skipped (i.e. if it’s a team of 2 vs. a team of 1, there’s only going to be one battle).</p>
      <p>● The team who eliminated the largest number of the opposing team is the winner.</p>
      <h2>Special Rules:</h2>
      <p>● Any Transformer named Optimus Prime or Predaking wins his fight automatically regardless of any other criteria.</p>
      <p>● In the event either of the above face each other (or a duplicate of each other), the game immediately ends with all competitors destroyed.</p>
